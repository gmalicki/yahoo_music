The Yahoo! Music API gives developers access to the Yahoo! Music catalog of artists, 
albums, tracks, videos, ratings and more. It provides numerous ways to browse the 
catalog: through charts, search, similarities, genres, artists, and user 
recommendations and ratings.

This library implements a ruby wrapper around the Yahoo Music API.  The result set
from each API call is returned as a Ruby hash.   The API is only a couple days old
so this library is not yet complete although a lot of important functionality is
available. 


Example usage:

require 'yahoo_music'

# create a new YahooMusic API instance using your Yahoo Music API Key.
ym = YahooMusic.new 'kKq7PobV34GpmKOYLFtflkij2CRaUQJVAxtracFYGgdk2ZfxUSeed3.a6j6KpRE-'

# preform a video search
video_data = ym.video_search('The Beatles')

video_data.class => Hash
video_data['Videos'].count => 10
video_data['Videos'].each { |video| puts video['uri'] }


# preform a video search that returns similar artists
video_data = ym.video_search('The Beatles', :response => ['videos', 'topsimilar'])


# preform an artist search
artist_data = ym.artist_search('Nirvana')
